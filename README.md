# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the project

The Vine program allows sellers to pay a small fee to recieve feedback from customers. This analysis will try to determine if ther is any bias that might cause Vine program buyers to give higher grades.

## Results:

### Total votes (filters)

Some products don't count with a significant number of votes to be considered in our analysis. We have determined that only productos with a vote count equal or higher than 20 will be considered for our study.

Not all votes are useful for a wide range of possibilites, so we will only consider the products which percentage of helpful votes is equal or higher than 50%.
